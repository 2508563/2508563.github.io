<p>Allison's favorite activities are eating, sleeping and sometimes walking. She likes to eat almost everything she can find, some food she does not like is toe jam, armpit juice and macaroni. She likes to sleep all of the time, she will only awake for her physiological needs as in eating. This is where her walking comes in hand. She walkes only when she is getting food or going to her bed to sleep.</p> </font>
