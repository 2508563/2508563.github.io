<a id="welcome-to-allisons-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-allisons-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to Allison Pages.</h3>

<p>Allison's favorite activities are eating, sleeping and sometimes walking. She likes to eat almost everything she can find, some food she does not like is toe jam, armpit juice and macaroni. She likes to sleep all of the time, she will only awake for her physiological needs as in eating. This is where her walking comes in hand. She walkes only when she is getting food or going to her bed to sleep. </p>

<p>Outside of Allison's activities she also has some hobbies. Her main hobby is sports. Her favorite sports are soccer and diving. She excels at both. Right now (2015-2016) Allison is on a select soccer team that is doing excellent in their league season. She does dive just over the summer at a neiboring pool and for her school. Last year she got 14th at disctricts.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
