<font color="white">
<p>Allison is the most superior name, it has the perfect amount of vowels and consonants, three and four. It also has one of the best letters, "A". The letter "L" is quite high up in the hierarchy of letters, it's like the military aid in a traditional hierarchy.</p> </font>

<font color="white">
<p>Allison's favorite activities are eating, sleeping and sometimes walking. She likes to eat almost everything she can find, some food she does not like are toejam, armpit juice and macaroni. She likes to sleep all of the time, she will only awake for her physiological needs as in eating. This is where her walking comes in hand. She wakes only when she is getting food or going to her bed to sleep.</p></font>

<a id="Allisons Hobbies" class="anchor" href="#Allisons Hobbies aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Allisons Hobbies</h3></font>
<font color="white">
<p>Outside of Allison's activities she also has some hobbies. Her main hobby is sports. Her favorite sports are soccer and diving. She excels at both. Right now (2015-2016) Allison is on a select soccer team that is doing excellent in their league season. Over the summer she was in many soccer tournaments with her team in which they got second in one and won their very last one. She does dive just over the summer at a neighboring pool and for her school. Last year she got 14th at districts and is hoping to progress in her skills.</p></font>

<font color="white">
<p>Allison's favorite color is blue and green. Her favorite number is 6 because it reminds her of the color green and her second favorite is 4 which is odd because it reminds her of the color red, which is not one of her favorites. A couple of her favorite foods are spaghetti, clam chowder and pizza.</p></font>
